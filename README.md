## Celeste

- Visual Studio C#
For programming and building the game. We use C# for all the game code.

- XNA
The engine for rendering and input.

- FNA & MonoGame
FNA and MonoGame are ports of XNA, and we use them to build the game cross-platform (Mac/Linux/Consoles). We could cut out XNA entirely and just use FNA for PC versions, but havenâ€™t felt the need to yet.

- Monocle
This is a simple C# framework we use on top of XNA that uses a Scene->Entity->Component structure, and includes collisions, animation, etc. The version in Celeste is fairly modified from the open source version linked.

## Stardew Valley

- XNA (but Eric recommended GameMaker since he says to took him too much time to do some things all by himself).

## Undertale

- GameMaker.

## Loop Hero

- GameMaker.

## Hades

- XNA.

## Terraria

- XNA.
